#Installation Plan for Tarlac Pilot

Everything that we do must be easy to replicate. Instead of writing out complicated documentation that nobody will ever use, we will write simple documentation that is part of our code base and which heavily relies on scripts to replicate everything that must be done. This document should be updated.

##Types of installation

##client

* Install Netbook Remix (even for HP laptops)
* Uninstall all games, applications, mail clients and lots of other stuff (visual application installer). But leave Firefox
* Install Fullscreen extension for firefox (kiosk mode)
* Set firefox homepage to CHITS
* [client install script](http://github.com/mikeymckay/chits/blob/master/install/TODO)

* Set optimum power settings when running on battery - lowest brightness, CPU scaling, etc.

##server

* install using github script
* [server install script](http://github.com/mikeymckay/chits/blob/master/install/chits_install.sh)

(discuss data security issues, server naming issues, etc)

##mysql replication

* install mysql-server
* setup slave mode replication on all non-masters
* setup master mode replication on master
